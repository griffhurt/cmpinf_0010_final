# CMPINF 0010 Final Project
By Griffin Hurt and Brandon Moretti

This project attempts to determine the best neighborhood for using public transportation in Pittsburgh by using three datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center:
1. [List of Pittsburgh Regional Transit stops](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-of-allegheny-county-transit-stops)
2. [Pittsburgh Regional Transit on time performance by route](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/port-authority-monthly-average-on-time-performance-by-route)
3. [List of Pittsburgh Neighborhood Boundaries](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2)
